# How To Contribute 

Thank you very much for wanting to contribute. 

You can contribute by either creating an issue or making a PR to add a new entry. If you have a conference you would like to be added but don't have the time to do it yourself, please create an issue for it. Don't forget to add the link to the conference in the issue description. 

If you find a typo or wrong grammer, feel free to make a PR or create an issue so that it can be fixed.

Do you have a better idea for how to structure the list? Make a PR.
